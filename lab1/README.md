# Monday MaxiLab 1: Modelling core overshooting in main-sequence stars

In this lab, you will learn how to set up a MESA model from scratch,
learn how to monitor the run, customise its output and how to choose
reasonable values for model parameters. Our science case is focused on
the effects of core overshooting on the core of main-sequence stars.

As a maxilab, this lab will take two 1.5h sessions. Each session is
organised in three sections, structured as below with an estimate of the
time you are expected to spend on each. Please do not hesitate to ask
your TA and/or the other people at your table for assistance if you
notice you are falling behind on schedule.

**SESSION 1**
1. Setting up your MESA work directory [20']
2. Modifying the input physics and saving your final model [30']
3. Monitoring the run and customising output [40'] (move some stuff into session 2)

**SESSION 2**
4. Adapting the input parameters [10'] (and play more with the pgstar plots?)
5. Making your own plots [20']
6. BONUS: automatically run multiple MESA models sequentially [20']

In this lab, we will examine how overshooting of a convective core
affects a star's evolution together. In particular, we will examine
how the numerical simplifications in this modelling may affect the model.
In doing so, we will learn how to find reasonable values for
model parameters, namely the initial mass of the star $M_\rm{ini}$,
its initial metal mass fraction $Z$, the overshooting scheme, overshoot
parameter $f_\rm{ov}$ which describes how far from the core the overshoot
can reach and $f_0$ which describes how deep in the convection zones the
model switches from mixing by convection to overshoot. To this end,
everyone picks one set of parameter values to simulate, after which we
will collect everyone's results and look for trends together. You will
also learn how to navigate the MESA output in greater detail and make
fully custom plots in Python, both using the dedicated ``mesa_reader``
Python package as well as 'by hand'.
If you have time left over, you can look into some prepared scripts that
automatically write parameter values into your inlist and runs different
sets of parameters sequentially.

---

## SESSION 1

### Setting up your MESA work directory

1. We will start from the mostly empty default MESA work directory and
slowly build it up until we have a properly fleshed-out main-sequence
model. Make a new empty directory somewhere on your machine, go into
the empty directory and copy over the default MESA work directory:

```bash
    cp -r $MESA_DIR/star/work/ .
```

Do a quick ``ls`` to check what is included in this default work directory.
You'll see a number of executables, namely _clean_, _mk_, _re_ and
_rn_. You can look at the summary at the start of this README to see what
these executables do. The subdirectories _make_ and _src_ contain the
Makefile and extra code to include, but you don't have to look into that
today. For now, let's take a look at the inlists _inlist_,
*inlist_pgstar* and *inlist_project*. These files describe what you want
MESA to do. In particular MESA will always look for _inlist_. Using your
favourite text editor, take a look at what is in _inlist_.

What this _inlist_ essentially does is redirect MESA to the other two
inlist files for all the real content, with *inlist_project* containing
most of the fields describing how the MESA run should go and
*inlist_pgstar* describing what visuals MESA should produce. For now,
let's focus on *inlist_project*.


2. To start, let's run a very simple main-sequence model of a star with
an initial mass of 5 solar masses and metallicity of 0.014 with some
strong step-wise mixing due to core overshooting. To do so, open
*inlist_project* and find and change the following parameters to the
given values:

```fortran
initial_m = 5d0
initial_z = 0.014d0
```

Next, to add the core overshooting, we need to add in some new fields.
Before you try to do so, have a look at the questions below.

```fortran
overshoot_zone_type(1) = 'burn_H'
overshoot_zone_loc(1) = 'core'
overshoot_bdy_loc(1) = 'top'
overshoot_scheme(1) = 'step'
overshoot_f(1) = 0.30d0
overshoot_f0(1) = 0.005d0
```

**Question**: The first three `overshoot_` fields describe where the  
overshooting should take place. Go into  
[the MESA documentation](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/index.html) and look up what each of these fields means.  
What other values are available? Meanwhile, `overshoot_scheme` describes what shape the  
overshoot mixing profile should take. Again, what are the alternatives to our 'step'?



**Question**: `overshoot_f` and `overshoot_f0` describe how large the  
overshooting region should be. How are they defined?


<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Both are given in units of the local scale height.  
`overshoot_f` is the total size of the overshooting region,  
while `overshoot_f0` describes how far into the convective region  
the model should switch from mixing by convection to overshooting.

</details>


**Question**: Where should you add these fields?


<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Strictly speaking, you can place them anywhere in the `&controls` namelist.  
However, you'll probably notice that `&controls` is organised into subsections like  
"starting specifications", "when to stop", "wind" and so on.  
Generally speaking, sticking to this or a similar structure is a good idea  
to keep your inlist clearly organised.  
As such, we recommend adding these new fields under `! mixing`.

</details>


**Bonus Question**: Why does each overshoot field in our example have that `(1)` at the end?


<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

All these `overshoot_` are actually arrays and `(1)`  
indicates the first element of that array.  
This way, each element can represent a different overshooting zone  
so you can use different overshooting settings for each zone.

</details>



3. While looking around your *inlist_project*, you may have noticed the
field called ``ZBase`` under the ``&kap`` namelist. This describes
the reference metallicity used in the calculation of the opacities.
For consistency, you should set ``ZBase`` to the same value as
``initial_z``.


4. Before you run your model, you should consider when the model is
terminated. Since we want to simulate the main-sequence evolution,
we should place our stopping condition around the terminal age
main-sequence (TAMS). Look under ``! when to stop`` in ``&controls``
of your *inlist_project*.

You'll note there are two conditions that can trigger
the model to end. The first is designed to stop the model at the
zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS), which we obviously do not want.
Therefore, set

```fortran
stop_near_zams = .false.
```  

The second condition is meant to stop the model around the TAMS.
Bear in mind that different people define
the TAMS in different ways, so you should always think about how
you want to define it.

**Question**: How does the default *inlist\_project* define the TAMS?



<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

When the mass fraction of \$^1\$H drops below 0.001.

</details>

For our purposes today, it would be interesting to include the hook at
the TAMS, since that is where the effects of core overshooting on the
star's position in the HRD are very pronounced. However, stars in this
mass range typically hit a central hydrogen fraction of 0.001 before
before reaching the hook. To ensure your model includes the hook, change
the lower limit on \$^1\$H to 10^-6.


5. Run your model by cleaning any executables in your work directory using

```bash
./clean
```

Then making a new executable using

```bash
./mk
```

and finally running that executable by

```bash
./rn
```

You'll notice that MESA writes a bunch of numbers describing your model to your
terminal, followed by regular updates on some key parameters summarising
the current state of your model. These are highly useful in examining how
your run is going. For instance, keep an eye on the central hydrogen
fraction (``H_cntr``) field, which will tell you how far along the main-
sequence evolution your model is. You'll note that it initially changes
extremely slowly. This is because MESA starts with a very small time step
which gradually increases, as shown by the ``lg_dt_yrs`` field.

After a while, two panels pop, one showing the evolutionary track of your
model on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and one the internal temperature
and density profiles. Like the terminal output, these help you keep an
eye on your model.



6. From all these numbers MESA wrote to your terminal, we've already
identified a way to improve the efficiency of our models.
The first 50 or so steps accomplish very little because the
time steps are very small. We can tell MESA to start with a time step
of one year, hence decreasing the required number of steps and speeding
up the run. To do so, add the following to the ``%star_job`` section of
*inlist_project*:

```fortran
set_initial_dt = .true.
years_for_initial_dt = 1d0
```

Note that this will only take effect once the star has reached the ZAMS.

Moreover, you will have noticed that before the run truly stars, MESA
first creates a pre-main-sequence model and lets it relax for 300
steps. For our purposes today, this relaxation is not critical,
so let's reduce the number of relaxation steps to speed up the
initialisation of our model to 100. To do so, add the following to
your ``%star_job``:

```fortran
pre_ms_relax_num_steps = 100
```


### Upgrading the inlist

7. *inlist_project* is currently mostly empty. This means that most
settings are using MESA's default values. You should always check
whether these are appropriate for your models. As an example, let's
consider the composition of the model. In steps 2 and 3, you already
set the metallicity mass fraction of the model. However, you also need
to think about how that mass is distributed across different elements
and isotopes.


**Question**: What is the default metal composition of MESA?


<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

You can choose from pre-defined compositions using the field `initial_zfracs`.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

By default, MESA uses the solar metal fractions of
[Grevesse & Sauval (1998)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998SSRv...85..161G/abstract).

</details>

Say you have decided that you would like to use the more recent solar metal composition found by
[Asplund et al. (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ARA%26A..47..481A/abstract).
Check the MESA documentation for how you can set that composition.



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

Note the initials of the authors on the Asplund et al. (2009) papers.

</details>



<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

The Asplund et al. (2009) composition can be set by adding:

```fortran
initial_zfracs = 6
```

to your `%star_job` namelist.

</details>




8. As you just altered the composition of your model, you should make
sure you are using an appropriate opacity table, like you did by
setting ``ZBase`` after changing ``initial_z``. Navigate to the
documentation of the kap module, which describes the opacities.



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

In the panel on the left, expand 'Module documentation' and open 'Opacities (kap)'.
To choose an appropriate opacity table, look for the 'Table selection' setting of 'kap module controls'.

</details>

Look through the available opacity tables.
Can you find the appropriate tables to be consistent with your metal compositions?



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

Add the following to your `&kap` namelist in *inlist\_project*:

```fortran
kap_file_prefix = 'a09'
kap_CO_prefix = 'a09_co'
kap_lowT_prefix = 'lowT_fa05_a09p'
```

</details>


9. After deciding on how the metal mass fractions are, let's take a look at how the hydrogen and helium fractions are set.

**Question**: What is currently the initial value of the helium abundance in your model? How did MESA compute this initial value?



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

Similar to how you set the initial metallicity with `initial_z`,
the initial helium abundance is set using `initial_y` in `&controls`.

</details>

The Y–Z relation described in `initial_y`'s documentation is a linear one,
with \$Y = Y\_p + \frac{dY}{dZ}Z\$, wherein \$Y\_p\$ is the galaxy's primordial helium content.
[Aver et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...03..027A/abstract)
suggest the primordial helium abundance \$Y\$ in the Galaxy is \$Y\_p = 0.2453\$.
Scaling to the solar composition, we find \$\frac{dY}{dZ} = 2.193\$.

Using these values, compute an appropriate initial helium fraction for your model
and implement it in your *inlist\_project*.



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

You should find an initial Y of approximately 0.276.
Add this into your `&controls` with:

```fortran
initial_y = 0.276002d0
```

It is recommended to place it alongside `initial_z` for clarity.

</details>


10. As this lab concerns fairly massive stars, mass loss by winds may play a considerable role.
    Check the documentation of `&controls` to see what implementations of mass loss are available.
    And what is the default mass loss?



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

In the panel on the left, navigate to
**Reference > Star defaults > controls > mass gain and loss**.

</details>



<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Broadly speaking, you can add mass loss by either setting a constant, negative value to the field `mass_change`
(with or without rotational scaling) or with some `wind_scheme`.

</details>

You will see in the documentation that there is a wealth of wind mass loss schemes available,
all of which can be scaled up or down. Each scheme is appropriate in particular regimes of the surface temperature, composition, etc.
The so-called Dutch scheme attempts to merge some of these schemes into a cohesive whole.
Add it into your *inlist\_project* without scaling it down.



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

In order to use the Dutch scheme at all temperature ranges and without changing its scaling, use:

```fortran
hot_wind_scheme = 'Dutch'
cool_wind_RGB_scheme = 'Dutch'
Dutch_scaling_factor = 1d0
```

</details>



11. MESA uses the mixing-length theory (MLT) to describe the
transport by convection. This theory relies on a scaling factor
$\alpha_{MLT}$ which is in general quite poorly calibrated.
As such, you should check what MESA's default value of this
$\alpha_{MLT}$ parameter is.

When you are working on your real science cases, you should
test a few different values for this $\alpha_{MLT}$ to gain
an understanding of its effects. However, to save some time
in this lab, we will stick to just one value, namely 1.8.
Add this into your *inlist_project*.


12. To check if you made any mistakes, run your model again.
You do not need to let it continue all the way to the TAMS,
just check it does not crash. Plus, you should be able to
use the terminal output to check if some of your changes are
working as intended.

<details> <summary>Show hint</summary>
In step 7, you reduced the number of pre-main-sequence relaxation steps from 300 to 100.
You also set the initial timestep to 1 year, which should be reflected in the lg_dt_years
value of the first few steps. The He_cntr of the first steps should also show your new value
for initial_y. You could also compare the values of some metals with your first run if you
haven't removed that terminal output yet. Finally, you should see the total mass of your model
decreasing slightly.
</details>


Despite how much you already added into your *inlist_project*,
there are still many empty headers. Indeed, when building
an inlist for your real science cases, you should still look
into your atmosphere settings, equation of state tables,
spatial and temporal resolution, and much more besides.
However, for the sake of time and not making this lab too
repetitive, we'll stop here and move on to adapting MESA's
output and tracking the model's evolution using PGPLOT.


### Customising output

13. Now let's turn to these animated plots, often called
the pgstar plots. These are incredible useful in understanding what
is going on in your model while its running, helping you spot
potential problems early. Therefore, it is worthwhile to customise
your pgstar panels to show those quantities that are the most important
to your work. To this end, MESA has a bunch of prepared windows you can
easily add by adding one flag to your *inlist_pgstar*. You can find
these and how to edit your *inlist_pgstar* in
[this documentation page]{https://docs.mesastar.org/en/24.08.1/reference/pgstar.html}.

For the purposes of this lab, we have prepared a specialised
*inlist_pgstar* for you. Download that *inlist_pgstar* here [TO DO]
and move it into your MESA work directory.

Run your model again to see what the new pgstar plots look like.
You don't have to wait for the run to be finished. You can interupt
it using ctrl+C if you're on Linux and Cmd+C if you're on Mac.

For some of you, this new panel may look terrible, either being very
small or overflowing out of your screen. This is because the width
of the pgstar window is dependent on your system and the size of
your screen. If the panel is too large or small for you, open
*inlist_pgstar*, find the two lines shown below near the start of
the inlist and play around with the values until it looks nice.

```fortran
Grid1_win_width = 10
Grid1_win_aspect_ratio = 0.7
```

<details> <summary>Show hint</summary>
You can edit *inlist_pgstar* while the model is running
and it will immediately update your plots.
</details>


14. We have merged all the plots in one panel for a better overview.
We also included some key quantities at the top, similar to MESA's
terminal output.
The plots are the HRD, a plot relating the star's age to the
model number and another MESA default panel: the mixing panel.
Finally, there is a mysterious mostly empty panel.
We'll get back to that empty panel later.


For now, focus on that mixing panel.



**Question**: What is the panel showing exactly? What does the colour of each line indicate?



<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

MESA treats the mixing of chemicals as a diffusive process.
The y-axis shows the logarithm of the diffusive mixing coefficient in cm²/s
(unless otherwise specified, MESA uses cgs units).
The colour indicates the process behind the mixing — blue for convection and white for overshooting.
These are the only two mixing processes in our model, but there are a plethora of other processes MESA can include.

</details>




15. So far, so good! Now let's think about the age plot. This is an example
of a history panel, where we plot two history quantities, i.e.
quantities that vary over time. Since we will explore the effect of
overshooting on the core in the second half of this lab, it would be
more interesting to change the y-axis of the history panel to
something more relevant such as the core mass. However, to do so,
you first need some idea of what history quantities are available.

You may have noticed that since running your model, a new subdirectory
named _LOGS_ has appeared. That is the default directory to which MESA
writes its output. In there, you will find files named _history.data_
and _profile{i}.data_. These track how a number of quantities vary over
time and the star's radius respectively.

So far, your history and profile output only contain the default
columns. To see what history output is included, open _LOGS/history.data_
with a text editor. You'll note a header on the first few lines describing
some essential aspects of your run and then on line 6 the names of your
history columns. The meaning of some columns will be mostly clear from
the name, but some are a bit obtuse.

Both to find out what these columns mean and to include extra columns,
we need to examine the file listing which history columns our model
should output. First, copy the default history columns list to your
work directory. Let's also give it a new name:

```bash
cp $MESA_DIR/star/defaults/history_columns.list my_history_columns.list
```

Open _my_history_columns.list_ and take some time to scroll
through the wealth of possible output MESA offers. Can you find the
meaning of some of the columns you saw in your _history.data_ file?
You'll notice that some columns are not yet documented. Feel very
free to ask the MESA developers present what they mean.

In this lab, we are interested in the effects of overshooting on the
stellar core. The mass of the convective core is already included in
the defaults. Now add the stellar radius and radius of the convective
core to the history output. Look for and uncomment the appropriate
fields.



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

The radius of the star is simply called `radius`.

</details>



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

For the radius of the convective core, look under the section marked by `!## mixing regions`.
Which field here would provide the core radius in a main-sequence star with a fairly large convective core?
How would you make sure the definition of this radius is consistent with the core mass?

</details>



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

For the radius, take the field `conv_mx1_top_r`.
To guarantee consistency with the core mass, use `conv_mx1_top` for your core mass.
Be aware that these are relative to the total radius and mass!

</details>



Once you have uncommented the relevant lines, you need to tell your MESA
inlist that you want to include the output columns in
_my_history_columns.list_ under ``&star_job`` :

```fortran
history_columns_file = 'my_history_columns.list'
```


16. Now we can finally turn back to the pgstar history plot. Open up
*inlist_pgstar* and navigate to the section where the history panel
is defined. Change the left y-axis to the default quantity of the
convective core mass.  

```fortran
History_Panels1_yaxis_name(1) = 'mass_conv_core'
```

**Bonus**: You could also use this panel to directly compare the two different definitions we might use.
How would you go about that?



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

The optional field `History_Panels1_other_yaxis_name(1)` lets you set the right y-axis.

</details>


**Bonus Question**: Which of these two definitions seems more convenient to you?
And what about the definition of the core radius?


What history and profile quantities we ask MESA to include not only changes
the output of our model, but also impacts pgstar's plotting options.
For instance, in order to plot a full Kippenhahn diagram, MESA needs to
keep close track of all the mixing regions. In order to enable that, go
into _my_history_columns.list_ and find the option named ``mixing_regions``.
As you can read in its description in _my_history_columns.list_, this is
not one quantity, but automatically adds a number of history columns.
Try uncommenting this ``mixing_regions`` and give it a fairly large integer
to ensure it includes all the relevant mixing zones, e.g.

```fortran
mixing_regions 20
```

Your pgstar window should now include fully functional panels. Briefly
run your model again to double check everything works as it should.


17. The history files tell you how chosen quantities vary over time. But
what about quantities that vary over the star's radius? Those are
described by the files _profile{i}.data_ in the LOGS folder. As with
the history, let's check study what is included by default and add
a few columns. First copy over the list file:

```bash
cp $MESA_DIR/star/defaults/profile_columns.list my_profile_columns.list
```

Again, take a few minutes to check out what it has to offer. Later
in this lab, we will examine the mixing profile at different times.
To this end, you will need the profile of the (logarithmic) diffusive
mixing coefficient and some way to tell what process is causing that
mixing. Find and uncomment some appropriate fields.



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

At minimum, include the fields `log_D_mix` and `mixing_type`.
Adding the contributions of each mixing type separately using `log_D_conv`, `log_D_ovr`, & co. is also recommended.

</details>

Remember to add your profile column list to your inlist:

```fortran
profile_columns_file = 'my_profile_columns.list'
```

---

**Bonus Question**: How often does MESA produce a profile file?
How could you increase this resolution?



<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

By default, MESA produces a profile every 50 model steps.
The most straightforward way to increase the frequency of the output is using `profile_interval`
in your inlist's `&controls` section. You could also set `write_profile_when_terminate = .true.`.

</details>



18. In the other labs today, you will learn how to run models that continue
after the main-sequence evolution. When doing so, it is quite annoying to
have to simulate the main-sequence again every time you tweak something in
your inlist. Instead, we can tell MESA to save a model at the end of a
main-sequence run so we can load that model in next lab. Add this to your
``%star_job`` and name your model:

```fortran
save_model_when_terminate = .true.
save_photo_when_terminate = .true.
! Give a name to the model file to be saved including your parameter values, e.g.
! 'M{your_M}_Z{your_Z}_fov{your_f_overshoot}_f0ov{your_f0_overshoot}.mod'
save_model_filename = ! Add your name here
```


19. Now let's run the model all the way to the end.
As the model runs, keep an eye on your new mixing panel in particular.
Compare it to those of the other people at your table.

---

## SESSION 2

### Trying different the overshoot parameters

You now know how to navigate your work directory and build up a
main-sequence model. That's great. However, so far we have
limited ourselves to simply adding in pre-chosen parameter values,
choices of tables etc. In real scientific applications, you should
always consider the impact of these settings, for instance by
trying a few different values. In particular, there are a number
numerical schemes and poorly calibrated physical parameters for
which you should think carefully about the appropriate value.
You already encountered some of these today, namely the
mixing length parameter $\alpha_{MLT}$ and the mixing by
overshooting.

In this session, we'll explore the impact of overshooting in
your model. Through your experiments and the lecturer's
discussion of everyone's result, you will learn how you
can find reasonable values and settings for overshooting
in your model. The plan is that everyone gets a unique
set of overshooting parameters, initial mass and initial
metallicity to try out. You will then compare the results
of these parameter settings to the model you produced in
lab 1. Meanwhile, we will collect some basic results from
everyone's model and examine the correlations between
different parameters together.

20. Go into
[this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qSNR-dV28Tr_RWv3bDu8OYsq7jTVcTQxmqzWqLM52es/edit?usp=sharing)
and put your name next to one set of parameters to claim it as yours.
Modify your inlist accordingly.

If you selected the **'no overshoot'** scheme from the spreadsheet,
you should leave the overshoot scheme as an empty string, i.e.

```fortran
overshoot_scheme(1) = ''
```

21. Before you run your model again, you should make sure you are
not overwriting your previous results. To do so, you should first
adapt ``save_model_filename``, ideally with some new name that
reflects the new parameter set.

Next, to not overwrite your history and profile data, you could
tell MESA to write the history and profile data to differently
named files. However, there is another, easier option, which
is to simply tell MESA to save the output in another directory
than *LOGS/*. Check the documentation or user forums to discover
how you can do that. Like the final model name, it is generally
recommended to use a name that reflects the settings of your
model, rather than something generic such as *model2*.  
Here’s the cleaned-up, collapsible version of that double hint block:



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

Since you already know what the default directory name is, *LOGS*,
you can look for the field with that default value using the search functionality of the documentation site.

</details>



<details>
<summary>Show hint</summary>

The field you need is `log_directory` under `&controls`.

</details>


22. Now run your model again. Keep a close eye on your pgstar plots,
particularly the mixing panel. Compare it with those of the
other people at your table.

23. Using your favourite text editor, open the history.data file and find
the line describing the TAMS. Add the values of the following parameters
to the second page of the spreadsheet. Take care to check your units!

 - log(Teff)
 - log(L)
 - core mass
 - core radius
 - age in Myr

MATHIJS TO TEAM: What output would be most useful? Teff and L are no-
brainers and the core conditions are relevant as well. What else?

24. Now let's wrap up this lab by reading your MESA output in using Python
and making some custom plots.

MATHIJS TO TEAM: What kind of plots should we have them make? One idea is
to make them plot the mixing profile of every profile together in one plot.
Another obvious option is to plot core mass/radius against (a proxy of) time.

## BONUS: Batch Parameter Studies with MESA

If you've completed the main lab activities and have time remaining, explore the automated parameter study framework in the [`batch_runs/`](./batch_runs) directory. This framework enables systematic exploration of overshooting effects across multiple stellar models.

### Why Run Batch Studies?

1. **Efficiency**: Run dozens of MESA models without manual intervention
2. **Thoroughness**: Test how overshooting parameters affect stellar evolution across different masses and metallicities
3. **Reproducibility**: Generate standardized output for consistent analysis

### Quick Start Guide

```bash
# Generate parameter-specific inlists
python batch_runs/make_batch.py batch_runs/MESA_Lab.csv

# Execute models sequentially
python batch_runs/run_batch.py

# Visualize results across parameter space
python batch_runs/plot_hr.py
python batch_runs/plot_ccore_mass.py
```

### Available Parameter Space

The provided parameter grid explores:
- Stellar masses: 2, 5, 15, 30 M☉
- Metallicities: Z = 0.014, 0.0014
- Overshooting schemes: None, Exponential, Step
- Overshooting parameters: 0.01-0.3
- Penetration depths: 0.001-0.01
